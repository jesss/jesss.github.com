{"body":"# Jessica Snipes\r\n### jsnipes@me.com\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nAlthough I've officially been in the tech industry for a mere 5 years, I've been tinkering with computers, gadgets, and general nerdery since the tender age of 8 when I decided to disassemble the family stereo/CD player to figure out why it wasn't working. After that it was the vacuum cleaner (that didn't go over very well), then I discovered MS-DOS and it was all downhill from there.\r\n\r\nI'm a passionate, hard working lover of technology who adores learning something new every day and a coworkers-who-make-you-laugh, enjoy-going-to-work, challenging/rewarding work environment. Over the years I've been fortunate to hold positions in which I could learn immense amounts from talented coworkers and unique work environments. My expertise ranges from outstanding customer service and people skills, to knowledge and understanding of the software development cycle, to basic web development — just to name a few.\r\n\r\n## Experience\r\n\r\n### Technical Operations Coordinator and Nerd Whisperer at Box\r\nJune 2011 - Present (1 year 8 months)\r\n_Project orchestrator, solution creator, efficiency facilitator._\r\n* coordinate and manage technical operations projects and events\r\n* manage and facilitate purchases of all datacenter and networking gear\r\n* operate/administrate self-created inventory management system (learned PHP and MySQL for it!) - manage domain and SSL certification process and portfolio\r\n* act as a liaison between technical operations and other teams\r\n\r\n### Internal Communications Specialist at Apple Inc.\r\nOctober 2010 - June 2011 (9 months) \r\n_Copywriter, editor, strategist._\r\n* copywriter for retail communication team\r\n* translated corporate directives into clear, compelling written communications for retail store audience - * created engaging stories and features for retail's internal communication publication\r\n* worked cross-functionally with other departments, teams, and stakeholders to accomplish goals\r\n\r\n### Creative at Apple Retail\r\nAugust 2008 - March 2011 (2 years 8 months) \r\n_Trainer, troubleshooter, problem solver._\r\n* delivered custom, discovery-based training sessions on Apple software and hardware \r\n* translated tech-speak into layman’s terms through the creative use of analogies\r\n* repaired relationships through timely troubleshooting and services at the Genius Bar\r\n\r\n### Libation Transportation Specialist at Thinking Man Tavern\r\nApril 2007 - October 2010 (3 years 7 months) \r\n_Server and Bartender._\r\n* multitasked with ease, served with efficiency\r\n* listened earnestly, learned on the fly constantly\r\n* served patrons food and drinks with style, personality, and attention to detail\r\n\r\n### Project Manager & Assistant Engineer at James Salter Music\r\nSeptember 2006 - February 2009 (2 years 6 months)\r\n_Managed and implemented all aspects of music recording sessions and production projects._\r\n* coordinated with musicians, labels, producers, engineers\r\n* arranged, wrote, and played/sung music as needed\r\n* soldered broken cables and repaired various equipment as needed\r\n* assisted during recording sessions including set-up of instruments/mics and recording environment\r\n\r\n## Honors and Awards\r\nCunningham-Traylor Academic Scholarship \r\nHOPE Scholarship\r\n\r\n## Education\r\n### Bachelor of Arts in Music – LaGrange College 2005\r\nMinor in Psychology, Ceramics\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
