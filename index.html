<hr><h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Although I've officially been in the tech industry for a mere 5 years, I've been tinkering with computers, gadgets, and general nerdery since the tender age of 8 when I decided to disassemble the family stereo/CD player to figure out why it wasn't working. After that it was the vacuum cleaner (that didn't go over very well), then I discovered MS-DOS and it was all downhill from there.</p>

<p>I'm a passionate, hard working lover of technology who adores learning something new every day and a coworkers-who-make-you-laugh, enjoy-going-to-work, challenging/rewarding work environment. Over the years I've been fortunate to hold positions in which I could learn immense amounts from talented coworkers and unique work environments. My expertise ranges from outstanding customer service and people skills, to knowledge and understanding of the software development cycle, to basic web development — just to name a few.</p>
